RICE Framework Guidance,,,,,,,,
"RICE is a scoring model to help prioritize features and initiatives based on four factors:

Reach: How many customers will this touch? (Enter as a number)
Impact: How much impact does  this have for each customer? (Nice to have, Medium, High, Must have)
Confidence: How confident are you in the Reach and Impact estimates?  (0-100 %)
Effort: How much work is required to build this? (XS/S/M/L/XL/XXL)

Formula: Priority Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Higher scores indicate higher priority items. Use this to make data-driven decisions about what to build next.

The mappings below define how text values convert to numbers for the calculation.",,,,,,,,
